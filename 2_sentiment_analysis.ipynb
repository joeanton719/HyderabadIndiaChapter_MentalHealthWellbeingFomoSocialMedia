I started working out and I am super proud of myself for that  \\- I don't really care about my looks as much anymore  \\- My screen time has decreased by quite a lot, I have social interactions in person way more now  So I guess what I'm saying is if you've been considering deleting social media for whatever reason, do it.\n",
