Each `body` will be associated with its corresponding `post_id`, which helps us identify the post that each comment or reply belongs to. Additionally, we’ll introduce a new column named `body_type`.

I believe Dr. K also made a video about this, and I found it incredibly important. Loneliness is about not having genuine connections with others. Sure, I have superficial connections with people at school, but in the end, they just make me feel more lonely. We should pay attention to the general loneliness caused by a lack of 'third places' and a lack of social interactions and understanding. It's not a gender thing. I've been lonely my whole life (I am female) and I had a hard childhood. It sucks seeing people on social media keep talking about men's loneliness while saying women have it so much easier... It's not about gender. The loneliness epidemic should be taken seriously.Edit: I also think loneliness is an individual thing. Everyone feels lonely for different reasons and comes from different backgrounds. It's not like all women experience the same childhood or anything similar. I understand that society expects men to be emotionless, and that's a specific issue for men. But that's all it is \\u2014 just one factor specific to men. Loneliness still affects everybody, and there are many other reasons.My main issues are that people keep saying how women have it easier, blame the \\\"male lonlieness\\\" on women and overlook women being lonely since \\\"women can't be lonely\\\". \",\n",
